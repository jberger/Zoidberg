 Zoidberg - a modular perl shell, version 0.96
===============================================

  http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net
 
  Zoidberg provides a modular Perl shell written, configured, and operated 
  entirely in Perl. It aspires to be a fully operational login shell with all 
  the features one normally expects. But it also gives direct access to Perl 
  objects and data structures from the command line, and allows you to run Perl 
  code within the scope of your commandline.

INSTALLATION

  First of all you need perl <www.perl.org>, it is very likely this is allready
  on your system. Zoidberg is tested for perl versions 5.6.1 and 5.8.2, but
  you are welcome to also file bug reports for other versions of perl.

  Modules which are not in the Zoidberg package but are depended upon by 
  Zoidberg are listed in the file "b/Requires.pl" -- these modules are
  available from CPAN <http://cpan.org>.

  On most clean systems you will need to install:
    Module::Build
    Exporter::Tidy

  The following are also recommended:
    Env::PS1
    Term::ReadKey
    Term::ReadLine::Zoid

  To install the package untar it, change to the new dir and type:
    > perl Build.PL
    > ./Build
    > ./Build test
    > ./Build install

  To install in your home dir try:
    > ./Build install install_base=$HOME/apps  
  or
    > ./Build appdir
    > cp -R Zoidberg/ $HOME

  To see all possible build actions type:
    > ./Build help
    > ./Build help action

  Zoidberg uses the installation targets 'etc', 'share' and 'doc' which are not
  used by Module::Build by default. Due to this these are very linux-centric.
  To override these installation (and configuration) paths do something like:
    > perl Build.PL --install_path etc=/my/etc \
                    --install_path doc=/my/doc \
		    --install_path share=/my/share

  If you need to add a directory to the include path -for example the install
  path where you installed the dependencies- use the PERL5LIB environment
  variable, using "perl -Isomedir" won't do.

  For advanced installation options, see the Module::Build documentation.

CONFIGURATION

  See the zoiduser(1) manual page.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

  To submit bug reports visit http://rt.cpan.org or mail the author.

  Currently we test with perl 5.8.2 and perl 5.6.2. 
  Please _do_ bug report for other  perl versions.

  The Zoidberg shell is being developed for GNU/Linux, but should also run on
  other flavours of unix. Please _do_ bug report bugs or OS dpendent problems
  for other operatings systems.
