 Zoidberg - a modular perl shell, version 0.98
===============================================

  http://github.com/jberger/Zoidberg
 
  Zoidberg provides a modular Perl shell written, configured, and operated 
  entirely in Perl. It aspires to be a fully operational login shell with all 
  the features one normally expects. But it also gives direct access to Perl 
  objects and data structures from the command line, and allows you to run Perl 
  code within the scope of your commandline.

INSTALLATION

  First of all you need perl <www.perl.org>, it is very likely this is already
  on your system. Zoidberg is tested for perl versions 5.6.1 and 5.8.2, but
  you are welcome to also file bug reports for other versions of perl.

  Modules which are not in the Zoidberg package but are depended upon by 
  Zoidberg are listed in the file "Build.PL" -- these modules are
  available from CPAN <http://cpan.org> or your CPAN client (i.e. cpanm).

  On most clean systems you will need to install:
    Exporter::Tidy
    File::ShareDir

  The following are also recommended:
    Env::PS1
    Term::ReadKey
    Term::ReadLine::Zoid

  To install the package untar it, change to the new dir and type:
    > perl Build.PL
    > ./Build
    > ./Build test
    > ./Build install

  To install in your home dir try using the `cpanm` client which 
  may be installed 
    1) from CPAN by installing the 'App::cpanminus' package
      or
    2) curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
  In the latter case the `--sudo` option is only needed if installing 
  using the system Perl. Once cpanm is installed, try
    > cpanm Bundle::Zoidberg
  which will manage the installation process for you! 

  To see all possible build actions type:
    > ./Build help
    > ./Build help action

  Zoidberg now uses the File::ShareDir architecture for keeping its shared
  files. This allows for greater portability of the install process. 
  Zoidberg will still search for zoidrc files at
    '/etc/zoidrc',
    '$HOME/.zoidrc'
  and plugins in 
    '/usr/share/zoid/',
    '/usr/local/share/zoid/',
    '$HOME/.zoid/' 
  as it did previously.

  If you need to add a directory to the include path -for example the install
  path where you installed the dependencies- use the PERL5LIB environment
  variable, using "perl -Isomedir" won't do.

  For advanced installation options, see the Module::Build documentation.

CONFIGURATION

  See the zoiduser(1) manual page.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

  To submit bug reports visit http://github.com/jberger/Zoidberg/issues 
  or mail the author.

  The Zoidberg shell is being developed for GNU/Linux, but should also run on
  other flavours of unix. Please _do_ bug report bugs or OS dpendent problems
  for other operatings systems.
