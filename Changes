0.92 Tue Dec  7 2004
	Releasing quickly due to the bug in the 'export' builtin, also packaging working
	'--help' and '--usage' switched for builtins and working history commands.
	- Fixed 't/31_ZoidbergError.t', it seems overload.pm prevented 'is_deeply()'
	from working correctly
	- Delayed history logging till after executng the command, so the command is able
	to modify what is logged; this was needed for 'fc' to work
	- The 'history' and 'fc' commands seem to work correctly now; also the 'cd'

	and the "core dumped" bit
	- Made default perl options a setting
	- Moved perl settings in "perl" sub-hash
	- Made the export builtin really move variables between the perl namespace
	and the environment; also the source-filter logic changed a bit for this

	- Added some prompt escapes to Z:Fish::ReadLine
	- Added completion for autoloaded contexts

        - Refactored the settings to control parser behaviour;
        all kinds of blocks can be wrapped in array refs again

     Sun Sep  5
        - Modified the format of redirections in the parse tree

     Wed Apr 14
        - Added Zoidberg::Shell::scalar to make the Z:Shell AUTOLOAD function
	work more DWIM'ish; it isn't perfect but it is pure perl.

0.2  We Feb 12 2003

0.1  Fr Dec 20 2002
	We decided to make an unstable release since there are lot of fixes since the
	0.04 release, but there is still a lot to do before releasing a stable version.
	The version numbering scheme changed today:
	- odd numbered minor numbers will only be used for (unstable) devel versions
	- versions will have only one major and one minor number for real changes
	- a second minor number points to (small) bug fixes (like typo's)
	So today we release the 0.1-devel-unstable version, the first stable release
	will be 0.2, we are looking forward to that release :)
